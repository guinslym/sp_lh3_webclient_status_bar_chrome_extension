# sp_lh3_webclient_status_bar_chrome_extension
An extension to swap the status bar emplacement and to blink the status bar select box when this one is in Busy mode

### Why
Most of the notification or centre of attraction are on the left of the screen (contacts, I'm staffing, Conference room new messages notification, New incoming Chat window -- The profile is on the left) the design of this webpage seems to follow LFT (Left to right) but the status selection is on the right.
